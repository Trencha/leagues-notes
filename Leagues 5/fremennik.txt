Before going to Fremennik to start on tasks, it is a good idea to make sure you have access to Hunter gear for the related tasks
- Kandarin, Varlamore and Desert have Hunter shops where you can get them
- If you have 71 Magic, Hunter Kit from the Lunar Spellbook will provide all of them
- There is a Bird Snare spawn on the Isle of Souls, west of the Fairy Ring
- You can get a Butterfly Net from Elnock Inquisitor in Puro-Puro
- There is a Teasing Stick spawn on Karamja coast near Fairy Ring CKR
- Noose Wand hard-requires 71 Magic for Hunter Kit if you can't buy it in a shop

Requirements are given below alongside each task, just skip the ones you can't do yet
