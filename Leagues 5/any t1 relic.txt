Some notes to bear in mind while you're doing early tasks:
- Do not do Mining and Smithing steps if you do not have the Mining relic
- All of the random events have tasks, so do them if you get them
  - Consider using the random event plugin to enable notifications for the ones you haven't done
  - Opening a Mystery Box is a task, so make sure to take that if you can
  - Equipping random event clothing (including the frog mask) also has tasks
  - Trading a herb with Jekyll is a task, so keep one on you until you've done it
- All forestry events have tasks, so do them if you notice them
- There are tasks to kill the following NPCs, some recommended times to kill them if possible are included in the route:
  - Barbarian in Barbarian Village
  - Chicken with fists
  - Cow with 1 hit
  - Duck with a Fire Spell
  - Frog (level 5)
  - Goblin (presumably any goblin)
  - Goblin holding a spear (the level 5 Goblins)
  - Mugger
  - Ram
  - Rat
  - Snake in Karamja
  - Spider in Lumbridge by kicking it
  - Imp with an Earth Spell
  - Dark Wizard south of Varrock
- If you find a Talisman somehow, use the Locate option with it
