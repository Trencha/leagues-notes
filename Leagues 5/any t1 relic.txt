Some notes:
- Skip Gertrude's Cat steps if you plan on taking Fremennik as your first region, as it will autocomplete
- Skip Rune Mysteries steps if you plan on taking Desert as your first region, as it will autocomplete
- Do not do Mining and Smithing steps if you do not have the Mining relic
- Some quests such as Gertrude's Cat might be autocompleted this League, obviously don't do the steps for tho
